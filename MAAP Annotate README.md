# MAAP-Annotate

For my final year project, I undertook a project to develop new tools and features for the existing application [MAAP Annotate](https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/9981). MAAP Annotate is an application developed for the Microsoft Hololens
that allows users to see and interact with 3D renders of Megalithic  art in augmented reality. My project report can be found in this repo and a video demonstration of the developed tools can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsEw8MTOGMw)
